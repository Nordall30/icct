  <details> <summary><strong>How to purchase a school uniform or student ID lace using the Student Portal?</strong></summary> 
   <div>
     <em>
       <p>
     First, you must be officially enrolled; This means that you have already generated an ORF, have a STUDENT ID NUMBER and have SET-UP or ACTIVATED a STUDENT PORTAL account. From your Student Portal, click on ACCOUNTS, then click on "Online Payment"; select or tick the school uniform or item/s to be purchased, then generate the REFERENCE NUMBER.
     </p>
     <p>
     Use the REFERENCE NUMBER to pay thru GCASH, 7ELEVEN, ECPAY and PALAWANPAY. When the payment is successful, you will automatically receive an "ICCT Info" text message to confirm that your payment has been reflected in your Accounts Ledger.
     </p>
     <p>
     Open your ACCOUNTS LEDGER from your Student Portal (ACCOUNT Menu); under Non-Assessment Fees, payments for your school uniform can be found there; go to the school's Supply Office (Cainta main Campus) or the Admissions Counter of your respective campuses to CLAIM your uniform from Monday to Saturday except Holidays, 7am to 7pm.
     </p>
     <p>
     School uniform size (XS to XL) is subject to availability and/or first come first serve basis; In the campus itself, you will say the size you need and you will actually measure it. Bigger than XL are order basis.

  <details> <summary><strong>What will happen to my ENLISTED SUBJECTS if I do not settle payments within 48 hours during the enrollment period?</strong></summary> 
   <div>
     <em>
       <p>
       During ENLISTMENT and ENROLLMENT period, each student can enroll subjects thru ONLINE PORTAL, PORTAL HOTLINES ASSISTANCE or WALK-IN ASSISTANCE. When we are not sure about the chosen SECTION, avoid clicking the SAVE and ASSESSMENT button so that you can choose another section. Check if all the subjects and number of units are correct before proceeding with the ASSESSMENT of FEES. In the Assessmet of Fees, check the subjects again if this is compatible or complete based on your enlisted subjects before choosing Mode of Payment, then Save Assessment. Press the Tentative & Assessment Button to generate your TCS.
       </p>
       <p>
       Please remember that the enlisted subjects or genrated TCS will remain your reserve slot within 48 hours. So please pay the downpayment, or full amount with discounts within 48 hours to proceed for the generation of Official Registration Form (ORF).

     If the cash basis discounted amount is P5,500, less DP P1,030 = P4,470 must be paid to Cebuana or MLhullier; put "CB" (Cash Basis) at the end of your student ID number; It is not possible to generate a Reference Number because your assessment is already tagged as installment basis, so it will be manually adjusted to your account when the teller encodes your payment.
     </p>
     <p>
     Every enrollment period, remember that the cash discounted amount can be availed as long as you have paid the full cash basis amount before the classes start.

   <div>
     <em>
       <p>
       Yes. If Full Payment with Discount was the mode of payment you chose when you enlisted and assessed fees, WE CAN STILL PAY DONWPAYMENT at Over-the-Counter Payment Centers such as Cebuana Lhullier, MLhuillier, Philippine Business Bank (PBB All Branches) or in Unionbak Online Payment. Put "DP" payment code at the end of your ID number (Ex. CA202312345DP). We are NOT able to pay with GCash or ECPay because we cannot generate a RefNum from our Student Portal because our account is in Full Payment mode of payment.
       </p>
       <p>
       After 2 to 3 days from the date of payment, you will receive confirmation of your payment via text message from "ICCT Info."
       </p>
       <p>
       In case you still want to avail the 10% discount for cash Basis, you can pay the balance based on the total discounted amount on or before classes start.
       </p>
       <p>
       If the installment basis payment mode is chosen, we can still avail the Full Payment with Discount by simply paying the full discounted amount on or before classes start at our Over-the-Counter Payment Centers.

       When the trimester or semester period is CLOSED and REGISTRATION is OPEN for the upcoming trimester or semester period, WE CAN STILL GENERATE
       </p>
       <p>
       REFERENCE NUMBER if paying thru GCash, ECPay and 7Eleven CLIQQ.
       </p>
       <p>
       1. In your Student Portal, click on the ACCOUNTS menu;
       </p>
       <p>
       2. From the Student Ledger / Transaction, press the trimester/semester period and year level where you have unsettled amounts;
       </p>
       <p>
       3. Then press the Online Payment button;
       </p>
       <p>
       Otherwise, we can settle thru Over-the-Counter Payment - Cebuana Lhuillier, MLhuillier and Philippine Business Bank; use your Student ID Number and add the payment code "AR" at the end; example CA202012345AR. The code "AR" is for the teller to know that the fees you paid were to settle your balances from the previous academic term.

     <em>
       <p>
       Now Enlistment of Subjects / Enrollment period, you can add subject/s during your COLLEGE and YEAR LEVEL Enlistment/Enrollment Schedule. It is not allowed to add subject/s once the classes have started.
       </p>
       <p>
       Approval to ADD SUBJECT/S will also be based from the following school policies and considerations:
       </p>
       <p>
       1. If the subject is a pre-requisite subject;
       </p>
       <p>
       2. If the subject/s is offered or open in such trimester period;
       </p>
       <p>
       3. If you have not exceeded the maximum number of units;
       </p>
       <p>
       4. If you are going to ADD a subject/s and are not yet officially enrolled or do not have an ORF, you do not need to pay the Subject Adding Fee; you can enlist that subject from your STUDENT PORTAL otherwise, go to your campus for WALK-IN ENROLLMENT ASSISTANCE during your college schedule;
       </p>
       <p>
       5. BUT if you are officially enrolled and the ORF has been generated:
       </p>
       <p>
       5.1 You must pay a Subject Adding Fee of P50 per subject;
       </p>
       <p>
       5.2 You can ADD a subject/s thru WALK-IN ENROLLMENT ASSISTANCE or call the PORTAL HOTLINES during your college schedule;
       </p>
       <p>
       5.3 Must provide or show proof of payment for the Subject Adding Fee;
       </p>
       <p>
       5.4 Then, check your portal for the NEW ASSESSMENT OF FEES, pay any additional fees especially if you are on a CASH BASIS to avoid changing the computation of your accounts;
